# popularMovies

*Popular Movies* Android app - my implementation of an exercise from the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853).

In order to build and run this app, you need a movieDB api key. You can get this api key by registering on the site [www.themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api).

Then define a variable

> MovieDbApiKey=`<YOUR_API_KEY>`

in the file `<USER_HOME>`/.gradle/gradle.properties.
