# Popular Movies

Project 1 & 2 from the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853).

Fully functional and colorful app which I created from scratch.

## Features
* Discover movies that are popular currently.
* Sort movies by popularity or release date.
* Watch trailers and read reviews.
* Mark movies as favorites to save them locally and view them when offline.

## HowTo
In order to build and run this app, you need a movieDB api key. You can get this api key by registering on the site [www.themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api).

Then define a variable

> MovieDbApiKey=`<YOUR_API_KEY>`

in the file `<USER_HOME>`/.gradle/gradle.properties.
